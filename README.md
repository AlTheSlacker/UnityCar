 Unity vehicle dynamics
 
 This provides an example of building a basic vehicle dynamic model in Unity. All the fundamentals are here, from powertrain and transmission to braking and aerodynamics.
 
 I've not added a dashboard, data-logger or any sound effects as these are beyond the scope of this project.
